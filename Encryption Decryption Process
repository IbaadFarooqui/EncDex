Each and every text charecter is assigned a numerical value to it, 
and these numerical values can be manipulated through mathematical equations such as 
addition, substraction, multiplication, division, etc, using Javascript's inbuilt functions.

By using Javascript, i have simply added the 'Key' charecter's numerical value to the 'Input' charecter's numerical value,
which results in the encrypted charecters. 
And by substracting the  'Key' Charecter's numerical value from the 'Input' Charecter's numerical value,
we can get the decrypted message.

A simpler way to understand this process is:

let's say that we want to encrypt a series of numbers = 12345
we can add a random number to it and call it a 'Key' = 95847:
12345 + 95847 = 108192

Now that the number is encrypted, the original value is now unreadable,
in order to decrypt the encrypted number, we will have to substract the 'Key' used to encrypted the number, from the encrypted number:
108192 - 95847 = 12345

using this simple addition and substraction method, we have encrytped and decrypted a number.
Using this same method we can encrypt and decrypt the text messages.
